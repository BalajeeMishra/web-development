            <h2>1. Coding and programming careers have great earning potential</h2>
            <p>One of the strongest and most obvious draws of learning to code is the earning potential for coding and
                programming professionals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks salary and other important
                workforce
                information for a variety of careers. </p>

            <p>Take a look at the BLS’ 2019 median annual salary information for these coding and programming-related
                professions:1</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web developers: $73,760</li>

            <h2>2. Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs</h2>
            <p>What good is a strong salary if no one is looking to hire for the position? When it comes to
                coding-related jobs, it appears there’s still plenty of opportunity. </p>

            <p>Here are the current BLS projections for employment growth in the same coding and programming-related
                professions:</p>

            <h2>3. Coding ability gives new perspective to problem-solving</h2>
            <p></p>

            <p>“Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think,” says Adrian Degus, CEO of
                Nuvro. He goes on to explain that he used to be more prone to solving problems emotionally. But his
                coding experience has taught him to approach problems logically</p>

            <p>“Understanding logic, at a deep level, has improved my problem-solving proficiency tenfold,” he adds.</p>
            <p>Coding, in its most basic terms, is really just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical
                guidelines you’ve outlined. Highly complex tasks are essentially a collection of smaller operations once
                you break them down. This methodical and logic-heavy approach to problem solving can be a boon for
                figuring out problems beyond a coding challenge</p>
